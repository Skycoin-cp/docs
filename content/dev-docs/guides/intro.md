The Developer Guide aims to provide the information you need to understand
Skycoin and start building Skycoin-based applications.

To make the best use of this documentation, you may want to install the current version of Skycoin core,
either from [source](https://github.com/skycoin/skycoin)
or from a [pre-compiled executable](https://github.com/skycoin/skycoin/releases).

Questions about Skycoin development are best asked in one of the
[Skycoin community channels](https://www.skycoin.net/blog/posts/skycoin-community-links/).
Errors or suggestions related to documentation on Skycoin.net can be [submitted as an issue](https://github.com/skycoin/docs/issues)
or posted to the [Skycoin developers discussion channel](https://t.me/skycoindev).
