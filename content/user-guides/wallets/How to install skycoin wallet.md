You are now the proud owner of your very own Skycoin Wallet. Congrats!
You can now send and receive Skycoin as well as earn CoinHours!
Remember though, with great power comes great responsibility....
Once you build up a sizable amount of sky you may want to secure it by back-
ing it up as a paper wallet. A paper wallet will allow you to get your skycoin off
your computer where it may be vulnerable to shady people. If your interested
in this Please follow our ‘How to secure your skycoin wallet’ guide.
