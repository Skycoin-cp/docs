With Skycoin gaining popularity and value every day it’s now more important than ever to make sure your coins are safe. This guide will walk you through the steps of converting your live wallet to a paper wallet to ensure your skycoin are offline and safe from would be thieves.

To secure your wallet just follow this steps:

## Step 1: Back up Wallet
The first thing we need to do is backup our seed. What’s a seed you ask? A seed is a string of Random words that will give you access to your wallet from anywhere.

Here is an example seed: “hello all from skycoin!!!!!! =)”

Just go to settings and click on "Back-up Wallet" option as follow.

## Step 2: Remove Wallets
Now comes the most important part. We are going to delete any and all copies of your wallet from your computer. The only copy you will have is what you wrote down on paper.

## Step 3: Restart Skycoin
Congrats! You have successfully secured your Skycoin wallet. The only copy in existence is the one you wrote down. There is no way for anyone to steal your Skycoin without that piece of paper. Another option would be to backup your .wlt files to a usb instead of writing it down. (or you could do both) Whatever you do, be sure you put it somewhere responsible like a fireproof safe. Good Luck!
