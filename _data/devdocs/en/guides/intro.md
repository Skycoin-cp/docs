The Developer Guide aims to provide the information you need to understand
Skycoin and start building Skycoin-based applications, but it is [not a
specification][]. To make the best use of
this documentation, you may want to install the current version of Skycoin core,
either from [source][core git] or from a [pre-compiled executable][core executable].

Questions about Skycoin development are best asked in one of the
[Skycoin community channels][dev communities].
Errors or suggestions related to
documentation on Skycoin.net can be [submitted as an issue][docs issue]
or posted to the [skycoin-docs mailing list][].

In the following documentation, some strings have been shortened or wrapped: "[...]"
indicates extra data was removed, and lines ending in a single backslash "\\"
are continued below. If you hover your mouse over a paragraph, cross-reference
links will be shown in blue.  If you hover over a cross-reference link, a brief
definition of the term will be displayed in a tooltip.
