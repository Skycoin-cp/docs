# How to secure your skycoin wallet

With Skycoin gaining popularity and value every day it’s now more important than ever to make sure your coins are safe. This guide will walk you through the steps of converting your live wallet to a paper wallet to ensure your skycoin are offline and safe from would be thieves.

## Export your wallet file
The first thing we need to do is backup our seed. What’s a seed you ask? A seed is a string of 12 Random words that will give you access to your wallet from anywhere. 

Here is an example seed:
“occur nuclear super cloud merry sniff aspect cat perfect atom absent social”

You may have already written this down when you first created your wallet. If you didn’t don’t worry you can still access it. In your Skycoin wallet application click Settings > Back Up Wallet. This will list all of your wallets and have a download link for each one. Download them to a folder you have access to. 

## Open .wlt in a text editor
Now that you have downloaded your wallet files you can read them by opening them in a text editor. Once they’re open, write your seed down on a piece of paper. Make sure you copy it perfectly! If you don’t you could lose access to your Skycoin forever.

## Delete .wlt files
Now comes the most important part. We are going to delete any and all copies of your wallet from your computer. The only copy you will have is what you wrote down on paper.

Drag the exported wallet files you made in step 1 into your trash and empty it. Then, Go back to your Skycoin application and click Settings > Backup Wallet again. This time, note the Wallet Directory at the top. Go to this directory and drag the .wlt files to your trash. Empty it and close out of your Skycoin application.

Congrats! You have successfully secured your Skycoin wallet. The only copy in existence is the one you wrote down. There is no way for anyone to steal your Skycoin without that piece of paper. Another option would be to backup your .wlt files to a usb instead of writing it down. (or you could do both) Whatever you do, be sure you put it somewhere responsible like a fireproof safe. Good Luck!
